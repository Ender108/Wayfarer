# Gameplay Guide

### Wayfarer is meant to be played on Very Hard difficulty with Hardcore mode enabled. You can change these options if you wish but it will negatively affect the intended balance.

- I strongly recommend taking a look at the Load Order Library and visiting the mod page for a mod you are curious or have questions about since I can't cover every gameplay change here. Below are what I feel to be the most notable ones.

## Loot and Balancing

- [JSawyer Ultiamte Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61592) is the definitive rebalancing mod for New Vegas, based off of the original plugin made by the game director Josh Sawyer. It aims to stay as true as possible to the source material, and clean up any inconsistencies or errors there were, whilst generally refining things and improving compatibility with other mods.

- [Famine](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74985) creates a much harder gameplay experience by making loot such as meds, ammo, and misc items more scarce. It also makes all weapons and armor found in the world in worse condition.

- [Repair Requires Materials](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75145) makes reparing equipment require a material that will be consumed (Scrap Electronics, Scrap Metal, Duct Tape, Wonderglue, Leather Belt) and a tool that has a chance of breaking (Wrench, Hammer, Whet Stone). The higher your Repair skill, the lower the chance the tool will break upon repairing an item.

## Survival

- [Water Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62635) makes adiation-free water sources much more uncommon, with most sources having at least a low level of radiation. Swimming and wading in water also gives more RADs. It also includes a water bottling system by picking up any empty bottle. facing a water source, and pressing the grab key.

- [RAD Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71541) decreases your max health based on how many rads you have, just like it does in Fallout 4. It also decreases your max action points depending on the severity of your Hardcore needs.

- [Immersive Fast Travel Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73627?tab=description) makes fast traveling require either Trail Mix or Caravan Lunch and a Clear Water from Water Overhaul. A new perk called "Well Traveled" can be taken at level 10 and 40 Survival skill to reduce/eliminate these requirements.

## Combat

- Combat in Wayfarer is deadly and faster paced. [BLEEDLESS](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75660?tab=description) increases the damage applied to limbs, as well as the force and radius of explosions. [Reload Reloaded](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62266) replaces the agility modifiers to reload and draw speed, strength modifiers to throwing range, and custom sneak attack damage multipliers. Sneak attack damage now scales with your Sneak skill; no longer are they a guaranteed 2x-5x damage boost.

- [Real Recoil](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62153) adds a simple recoil system to all guns. [Consistent Spread](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77974) fixes the buggy wobble when aiming down sights. [Dynamic Weapon Spread](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74321) makes aiming down sights far more accurate, but each shot you fire makes the next less accurate depending on your weapon skill and strength.

- [Weapon Requirement System](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69161?tab=description) adds penalties to weapons if you do not meet the strength and/or skill requirements for them; Guns will be less accurate and reload slower, melee weapons will swing slower and have a chance to deal no damage, grenades will not detonate, thrown weapons will fall at your feet, and mines will not detonate or even blow up as soon as you lay them.
