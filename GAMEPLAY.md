# Gameplay Guide

### I strongly recommend taking a look at the Load Order Library and visiting the mod page for a mod you are curious or have questions about since I can't cover every gameplay change here. Below are what I feel to be the most notable ones.

- [JSawyer Ultiamte Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61592) is the definitive rebalancing mod for New Vegas, based off of the original plugin made by the game director Josh Sawyer. It aims to stay as true as possible to the source material, and clean up any inconsistencies or errors there were, whilst generally refining things and improving compatibility with other mods.

- [Famine](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74985) creates a much harder gameplay experience by making loot such as meds, ammo, and misc items more scarce. It also makes all weapons and armor found in the world in much worse condition.

- Repairing equipment has been made much less trivial thanks to [Repair Requires Materials](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75145). Simply put, you need a material (Scrap Electronics, Scrap Metal, Duct Tape, Wonderglue, Leather Belt) and a tool (Wrench, Hammer, Whet Stone) to repair equipment. The higher your Repair skill, the lower the chance the materials and tools will break upon repairing an item.

- [RAD Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71541) decreases your max health based on how many rads you have, identical to Fallout 4. It also decreases your max action points depending on the severity of your Hardcore needs.

- Combat is deadly and fast paced. [BLEEDLESS](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75660?tab=description) increases the damage applied to limbs, as well as the force and radius of explosions. [Progressive Sneak Attack Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77571) makes sneak attack damage scale with your Sneak skill; no longer are sneak attacks a guaranteed damage boost.

- [Immersive Fast Travel Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73627?tab=description) makes fast traveling require either Trail Mix or Caravan Lunch and a Clear Water. A new perk called "Well Traveled" can be taken at level 10 and 40 Survival skill to reduce/eliminate these requirements.

- Gunplay has been greatly improved. [Real Recoil](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62153) adds a simple recoil system to all guns. [Dynamic Weapon Spread](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74321) + [Consistent Spread](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77974) fixes the strange inaccurate wobble when aiming down sights, and aiming down sights is far more accurate but more prone to much harsher spread penalties if you do not meet the skill and strength requirements of your equipped gun.
