### Repair
- Repairing equipment has been made much less trivial thanks to [Repair Requires Materials](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75145). Simply put, you need a material (Scrap Electronics, Scrap Metal, Duct Tape, Wonderglue, Leather Belt) and a tool (Wrench, Hammer, Whet Stone) to repair equipment. The higher your Repair skill, the lower the chance the materials and tools will break upon repairing an item.
