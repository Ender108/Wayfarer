# Gameplay Guide

- [Famine](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74985) creates a much harder gameplay experience by making loot such as meds, ammo, and misc items much more scarce. It also makes all weapons and armor found in the world in much worse condition.

- Repairing equipment has been made much less trivial thanks to [Repair Requires Materials](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75145). Simply put, you need a material (Scrap Electronics, Scrap Metal, Duct Tape, Wonderglue, Leather Belt) and a tool (Wrench, Hammer, Whet Stone) to repair equipment. The higher your Repair skill, the lower the chance the materials and tools will break upon repairing an item.

- [RAD Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71541) decreases your max health based on how many rads you have, identical to Fallout 4. It also decreases your max action points depending on the severity of your Hardcore needs.

- Combat is deadly and fast paced. [BLEEDLESS](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75660?tab=description) increases the damage applied to limbs, as well as the force and radius of explosions. [Progressive Sneak Attack Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77571) makes critical sneak attack damage scale with your Sneak skill; no longer are sneak attacks a guaranteed damage boost.
