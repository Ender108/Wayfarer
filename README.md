  </div>
  
##[Changelog]

### Introduction

Wayfarer is a lightweight Wabbajack modlist for New Vegas. The goal of Wayfarer is to greatly improve and modernize gameplay without completely overhauling the core New Vegas experience. Wayfarer also includes all essential stability mods and keeps visual mods to an absolute minimum to maximize performance.

This modlist was built off of the excellent Viva New Vegas guide. Please go check it out as it's a great resource for New Vegas modding.

### Installation Steps

1. Download and install Visual C++ 2019.
2. Download and install .NET Framework 4.8.
3. Uninstall Fallout: New Vegas if you already have it installed through Steam or GOG. Ensure the game folder is deleted (...Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas OR ...GOG Galaxy\Games\Fallout New Vegas). Ensure the INI files folder is deleted (...Documents\My Games\FalloutNV)
4. Download and install Fallout: New Vegas through Steam or GOG. It must be installed outside of the Program Files folders in your Windows drive, and the game's language must be set to English.
5. Run Fallout: New Vegas through Steam or GOG to generate the INI files, click OK, and then click Play. Once you are at the main menu, you can exit.
6. Download and install Wabbajack in any location if you haven't already. Click the settings icon in the top right then log in with your Nexus Mods account.
7. Download the "Wayfarer - Wabbajack File" from the Files tab, then extract the file anywhere you'd like.
8. Launch Wabbajack and click Install From Disk, click the three dots next to Target Modlist, then point it to wherever you downloaded the Wayfarer.wabbajack file.
9. Click the three dots next to Modlist Installation Location and select a location to install Wayfarer. DO NOT install the modlist in the Wabbajack installation folder OR the Fallout New Vegas installation folder.
10. Click the Start Arrow button and let Wabbajack do its thing. If it gives you an error during installation, exit Wabbajack and try installing the list again.
