### Introduction

Wayfarer is a lightweight difficulty based modlist for New Vegas. The goal of Wayfarer is to improve gameplay in a challenging yet rewarding way without completely overhauling the core New Vegas experience. Wayfarer also includes all essential stability mods and keeps visual mods to an absolute minimum to maximize performance.

This modlist was built off of the excellent Viva New Vegas guide. Please go check it out as it's a great resource for New Vegas modding.

### Requirements

- Global steam version of Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition (PSR/RU versions not supported). The GOG version is NOT supported.
- Any PC from the last decade (a SSD is also highly recommended).


### Installation Steps

1. Download and install [Visual C++ 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Download and install [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer).
3. Uninstall Fallout: New Vegas if you already have it installed through Steam. Ensure the game folder is deleted (...Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas). Ensure the INI files folder is deleted (...Documents\My Games\FalloutNV)
4. Download and install Fallout: New Vegas through Steam. It must be installed outside of the "Program Files: folders in your Windows drive, and the game's language must be set to English.
5. Run Fallout: New Vegas through Steam to generate the INI files, click "OK", and then click "Play". Once you are at the main menu, you can exit the game.
6. Download and install Wabbajack in any location if you haven't already. Click the settings icon in the top right then log in with your Nexus Mods account.
7. In the Wabbajack main menu, click "Browse Modlists", in the dropdown menu in the top right select "Fallout New Vegas", then click "Show Unofficial Lists".
8. Click the download button under Wayfarer then click the play button. Click the three dots next to "Modlist Installation Location" and select a location to install Wayfarer. DO NOT install the modlist in the Wabbajack installation folder OR the Fallout New Vegas installation folder.
9. Click the start arrow button and let Wabbajack do its thing. If it gives you an error during installation, exit Wabbajack and try installing the list again.
10. THIS STEP IS NOT OPTIONAL! Once Wayfarer installation is complete, go to your Wayfarer installation folder and open the "BSA Decompressor" folder. Run "FNV BSA Decompressor.exe", click "Browse", then point it towards the "Stock Game" folder in your Wayfarer installation. Click "Decompress" and then wait a few minutes.
10. Once the BSA Decompressor is completed you can exit, then navigate to your Wayfarer installation directory and open "ModOrganizer.exe".
11. Click "Run" in the top right corner. You are now playing Wayfarer. Good luck and happy trails!

### New Game Steps
1. After exiting Doc Mitchell's house, pasue the game and open the Mod Configuration Menu, click "Vicious Wastes", click "Main", and then scroll down to click "Load Preset". This will load a custom Vicious Wastes preset made for Wayfarer. You can change any of the MCM options for VW as you see fit, just keep in mind it will affect the balance intended for Wayfarer.
2. Other MCM options under FOV Slider and Just Mods can be customized however you want.
3. If you want a vanilla-eqsue experience without any of the difficulty enhancing gameplay from Vicious Wastes, enable "Wayfarer - Vanilla Gameplay INIs" under the "Optional Mods" tab. Follow the Step 1 to load the necessary vanilla preset.
