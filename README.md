### Introduction

Wayfarer is a lightweight Wabbajack modlist for New Vegas. The goal of Wayfarer is to greatly improve and modernize gameplay without completely overhauling the core New Vegas experience. Wayfarer also includes all essential stability mods and keeps visual mods to an absolute minimum to maximize performance.

This modlist was built off of the excellent Viva New Vegas guide. Please go check it out as it's a great resource for New Vegas modding.

### Requirements

- Steam version of Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition.
- Any PC from the last decade (a SSD is also highly recommended).


### Installation Steps

1. Download and install [Visual C++ 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Download and install [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer).
3. Uninstall Fallout: New Vegas if you already have it installed through Steam. Ensure the game folder is deleted (...Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas). Ensure the INI files folder is deleted (...Documents\My Games\FalloutNV)
4. Download and install Fallout: New Vegas through Steam. It must be installed outside of the Program Files folders in your Windows drive, and the game's language must be set to English.
5. Run Fallout: New Vegas through Steam to generate the INI files, click OK, and then click Play. Once you are at the main menu, you can exit.
6. Download and install Wabbajack in any location if you haven't already. Click the settings icon in the top right then log in with your Nexus Mods account.
7. In the Wabbajack main menu, click Browse Modlists, in the dropdown menu in the top right select Fallout New Vegas, then click Show Unofficial Lists.
8. Click the download button under Wayfarer then click the play button. Click the three dots next to Modlist Installation Location and select a location to install Wayfarer. DO NOT install the modlist in the Wabbajack installation folder OR the Fallout New Vegas installation folder.
9. Click the Start Arrow button and let Wabbajack do its thing. If it gives you an error during installation, exit Wabbajack and try installing the list again.
10. Once Wayfarer installation is complete, go to your Wayfarer installation folder and open the BSA Decompressor folder. Run FNV BSA Decompressor.exe, click Browse, then point it towards the Stock Game folder in your Wayfarer installation. This process will take a few minutes.
10. Once the BSA Decompressor is completed you can exit, then navigate to your Wayfarer installation directory and open ModOrganizer.exe
11. Click Run in the top right corner. You are now playing Wayfarer. Good luck and happy trails!
